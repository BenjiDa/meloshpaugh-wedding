<h4>Our Story</h4>

<p> It was just another evening in D.C. when Ann Margaret went over to her friend Yael's house for another dinner party. Little did she know that Ben was in town visiting his friend Brannon (Yael's house-mate). After dinner, music on the porch and many happy moments, Ann Margaret lent Ben her bike-share key (aka Bixi Key), Ben knew she was special. After a live concert at the local farmers market, they went sailing on the Potomac River and Ben was very impressed that she could steer the boat with her foot while having a casual conversation! Next thing you know, the two new friends were having coffee in Virginia, they said good-bye and went their separate ways.</p>

<p> Luckily for our story, and this new budding relationship, Ben didn't travel far. In fact, he only made it to Gainesville, FL. There, with help from his music producing cousin, he made several new music videos including the hit single "Bageland" and clandestinely sent them to his new friend - Ann Margaret. A few weeks and many text messages later, Ben and Ann Margaret were reunited in Tennessee for an extended weekend get away in the Smokey Mountains. There, despite the fact that she was picked up in a Ford Mustang and had somehow met the only Geologist who couldn't keep rain out of a tent (aka slept in a puddle), Ann and Ben began to fall in love.</p>

<p> After several cross country rendezvouses, Ann Margaret and Ben decided they wanted to stick together, and Ann Margaret moved to northern California. It was there on a warm summer afternoon on Mendocino's Eel River where Ben proposed to Ann Margaret, the most beautiful person he had ever met.</p>

<p> Now we invite all of you, who have undoubtedly already played a huge role in our relationship, to join us yet again and celebrate our love. It is from this moment which we will embark on many more exciting memories and adventures.</p>
