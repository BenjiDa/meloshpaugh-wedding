<h3>Travel</h3>

<p>Solomon's Island is approximately a 1.5 hour drive from Washington, D.C. There is little public transit available and renting a car for the week is your best option. There will be shuttles available to the wedding from hotels close by. Many of the hotels are also walking distance.</p>
